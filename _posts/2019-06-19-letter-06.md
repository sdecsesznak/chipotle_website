Dear Chipotle Headquarters, 

This letter adopts a new format.  As a scrupulous music lover, my thoughts, emotions, and general feelings of wellbeing are usually best expressed with lyrical finesse that few artists possess.  As a true analog in a digital era, my favorite artists stem from a time which I wasn’t apart of. The genuine sincerity and humble honesty these artists display make them a deserving beneficiary of admiration. 

My attempts at expressing feelings of strong intimacy with Chipotle will hopefully be demystified with the elegant words of the two and only, Mr. Gaye and Ms. Terrel.  

**Mental instrumentals of Ain’t No Mountain High Enough cue**

> Listen, baby<br>
> Ain't no mountain high<br>
> Ain't no valley low<br>
> Ain't no river wide enough, baby<br>
<br>
> If you need me, call me<br>
> No matter where you are<br>
> No matter how far (Don't worry, baby)<br>
> Just call my name<br>
> I'll be there in a hurry<br>
> You don't have to worry<br>
> Cause baby there<br>
<br>
> Ain't no mountain high enough<br>
> Ain't no valley low enough<br>
> Ain't no river wide enough<br>
> To keep me from getting to you, babe<br>
<br>
> Remember the day<br>
> I set you free<br>
> I told you you could always count on me, darling<br>
> From that day on, I made a vow<br>
> I'll be there when you want me<br>
> Someway, somehow<br>
> Oh baby there<br>
<br>
> Ain't no mountain high enough<br>
> Ain't no valley low enough<br>
> Ain't no river wide enough<br>
> To keep me from getting to you, babe<br>
 <br>
> Oh no, darling<br>
 <br>
> No wind, no rain<br>
> Nor winter storm<br>
> Can't stop me, baby<br>
> <br>
> No, no baby<br>
> <br>
> Cause you are my goal<br>
> <br>
> If you're ever in trouble<br>
> I'll be there on the double<br>
> Just send for me<br>
> <br>
> Oh, baby!<br>
> <br>
> My love is alive<br>
> Way down in my heart<br>
> Although we are miles apart<br>
> <br>
> If you ever need a helping hand<br>
> I'll be there on the double<br>
> Just as fast as I can<br>
> <br>
> Don't you know that there...<br>
> Ain't no mountain high enough<br>
> Ain't no valley low enough<br>
> Ain't no river wide enough<br>
> To keep me from getting to you, baby<br>
> Ain't no mountain high enough<br>
> Ain't no valley low enough<br>
> Ain't no river wide enough<br>
> Ain't no mountain high enough<br>
> Ain't no valley low enough <br>
