Dear Chipotle Headquarters, 

I am writing you this letter at 7:53am from my 15th floor Embassy Suites hotel room in FT Worth, Texas.  I do not know why but my head hurts and my body aches.  All I can think is “What happened last night?”

Here are the events that I can recall from last night:<br>
<br>
7:32pm – I head over to Chipotle with nothing but Burritos on my mind.<br>
7:38pm - Arrive at Chipotle.  NO LINE.  I think to myself, “God shows up in unexpected places”<br>
7:39pm – Execute my order perfectly to the Chipotle line work.  Glad I practiced in the car. <br>
7:40pm – Get to the POS, and asked the cashier for her number.  She says $7.98.  <br>
7:41pm – Seatbelt my burrito in.  This confuses the woman getting out of the car next to me.<br>
7:46pm – Valet asks how my trip was.  “SHH, she’s sleeping” as I point to the bag I am cradling.<br>
7:50pm – From here on, things get hazy..<br>
<br>
The last think I remember is taking my shirt off, turning the lights off and switching on the TV.  The channel was on a telenovela - I turn the volume up all the way up for some reason. 
<br>
As I sit here writing you this letter, I see guacamole smeared on the walls.  Not much guacamole but enough to warrant a second glance.  I do not know what came over me last night but this was my first burrito blackout.  <br>
<br>
I will send you updates as I try to piece together what happened.<br>
<br>
Confused,<br>
