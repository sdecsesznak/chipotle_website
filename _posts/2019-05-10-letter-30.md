Dear Chipotle Headquarters, 

We all have dreams. Martin Luther King dreamt of racial harmony. Lindsey Lohan dreamt of less judgement.  Mike Tyson dreamt of a world without all thith madneth.  For over a decade, I have dreamt about free burritos for life.

As this is my fourth letter, I think it is appropriate that we get more acquainted; I know so much about you and you know nothing about me. I am a blooming 24-year-old with the humor of a prepubescent teenager.  In my free time, I like to vape (mango pods only), listen to my Soundcloud playlist (username: Steven deCsesznak -- Check me out) and of course eating copious amounts of Chipotle.  My favorite pastime compromises of doing all three of these activities simultaneously and then looking at myself in the mirror while wiping the leftover guacamole off my face. 

I recently went on a Chipotle date which was abruptly terminated with her describing Qdoba as “Having better tasting food”.  Turns out an apology doesn’t go as far as you’d think when “You left me at Chipotle without my phone or car”. Her words not mine.  

This past Easter (Sunday, April 21st), I realized Chipotle was closed so I spent a few hours with my family.  They seem like good people. 

So, who is this “Moderation” every keeps telling me to eat Chipotle with? 

Yours Literally,
,<br>
