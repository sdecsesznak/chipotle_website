Dear Chipotle Santa Claus,

My name is Steven and I am 24 years old.  I hope that you are all rested up from delivering presents last year.  I want you to know that I have been very good this year, and I listened to my parents.  I really hope I am on the nice list.  

This year I would really like a VIP Chipotle Free Burritos for Life gift card.  

Please say hello to all the North Pole elves for me.  

Sincerely,<br>
