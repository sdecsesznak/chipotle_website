Dear Chipotle Headquarters, 

I’ve hit GUAC bottom.  Today marks the fourth day of going to Chipotle.  Fours days of mouthwatering GUAC with a side of Burrito.   I know the GUAC is extra, but so am I!  

Yesterday, I went to Chipotle with a few colleagues.  Halfway through the meal one of my friends expressed his concern that I wouldn’t be able to finish my baby of a burrito bowl.   I calmly turned towards him and said, “Don’t worry, I GUAC this”. 

The thing is, I don’t give a GUAC if my friends think I can finish my burrito or not. Each time I sit down with Chipotle, I imagine I am competing in the great GUAC off!  It is between my burrito bowl and me.  

You GUAC my world!

Respectfully,<br>
