Dear Chipotle Headquarters,<br>
<br>
Hope you enjoyed the mixtape I sent you! As a general reminder, a fire extinguisher might be needed due to the amount of fire it contains. üî•<br>
<br>
Apologies for the delay, these past couple weeks have been eventful to say the least. <br>
<br>
In the past two weeks, I have frequented multiple Chipotle establishments.  My networking efforts have been lackluster, so I decided to broaden my horizons. Although I felt guilty of chipoltery, I always left fully satisfied.  During one visit, I asked the Burrito keeper behind the counter to add some **updog** to my burrito.  She was not amused and neither was I with that reaction.  One of my life mottos is *‚ÄúWhen in doubt, double down‚Äù* which is exactly what I did.  When I got to the gentlemen behind the POS, I asked for a side **goodfam** expecting a ‚ÄúWhats Good Fam‚Äù response but was only met with ‚ÄúWe ran out of that yesterday‚Äù.  Needless to say, I cried all night.  <br>
<br>
I tried to use a coffee filter as a mask, but the Walmart greeter told me I could not enter.  I calmly asked her to please not talk to me before my morning coffee but was quickly interrupted by a security guard trying to escort me out. I quickly retorted that words cannot espresso how sorry I was but was dragged out anyways. Oh well, I don‚Äôt give a Frappe.<br>
<br>
I find it ironic I need to wear a mask to get money from a bank.  <br>
<br>
Warm Regards,<br>
