Dear Chipotle Headquarters,<br>
<br>
Hope you are staying positive and testing negative.<br>
<br>
I think these past couple of weeks have been stressful for everyone.  With the election results being announced, Friday the 13th in **2020** coming and going, and now Covid-19 cases skyrocketing, everyone needs an outlet.  <br>
<br>
For me, one of my favorite pastimes is spending time on my favorite social media platform, Venmo, commenting on random peopleâ€™s transactions.  Honestly, it is a great place to meet new people and network.  10/10 would recommend. <br>
<br>
My Doctor called me 3 times yesterday just to tell me my zodiac sign.  What a goober!! <br>
<br>
LOVE YOU,<br>
