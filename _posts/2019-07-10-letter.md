Dear Chipotle Headquarters, 

I appreciate you writing back.  Thank you for the entrée gift cards; that was very generous as I am only eight letters deep. I do have a few questions regarding your letter that I would like to address.  As seen below in Figure 1, this is the exact picture that was sent in the letter

After my 24th glance of this figure, I noticed something strange.  The subtitle explicitly states 365 Letters which made me think he wrote one letter a day for a year.   After several hours of conducting research and multiple trips to the local grocery store to reup on ice cream, I have concluded that you were implying I should write to you every day.  For your convenience, Figure 2. Displayed on page 2 illustrates the same picture within context of the storyline (Which I can now recite verbatim).

While I am flattered to move this relationship to the next level, I don’t feel comfortable with this amount of intimacy.  My extensive time involvement loitering around Bellevue’s local Chipotle doesn’t 

Sincerely,



Steven A. deCsesznak 

P.S. – This Monday (While at Chipotle – Obviously), the Chipotle Cashier did not charge me for chips.  I have enclosed the exact amount with tax that I owe.
