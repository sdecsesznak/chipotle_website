Dear Chipotle Headquarters, 

With Thanksgiving just around the corner, I find it quite appropriate to reflect on this past year with an attitude of gratitude.  

More often than not, I find myself unappreciative of the many blessings that I have received.  More often than not, my thoughts are rooted in the things I donâ€™t have and not that things that I do have.  With this said, I would like to express my many thanks for what Chipotle has provided me. 

With an extensive list of items that I am thankful for, here are just a few that directly related to your friendly establishment.

1.	 I am grateful for your commitment to the community in providing high quality food at an affordable price.
2.	 I am grateful for the extra half scoop of chicken that ensues when ordering a burrito bowl. 
3.	 I am grateful for your dedication to guacamole puns.  They always make me smile.
4.	 I am grateful to interact with upbeat Chipotle Crew Members 
5.	 I am grateful to be able to eat Chipotle. 

Thank you for everything you do!  I look forward to this our relationship for years to come.

With Love,<br>
