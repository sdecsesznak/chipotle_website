Dear Chipotle Headquarters, 

As I’m sitting here starting to write my regular Chipotle letter, and I can’t help but feel distracted.  It has been two long weeks since my last letter which is not consistent with my weekly letter requirement.  To be honest, work has been extremely challenging; my new manager gave me an assignment which requirement me to learn a new coding language.  

A couple days ago I was thinking about how eating a Chipotle burrito is like undertaking a challenge.  When you first start, it is very intimidating, and you don’t know if you have that amount of drive in you.  Can I do this?  It’s too complicated.  It’s too big... Why did I get guacamole?  But taking that initial leap of faith is the difference between the Doers and the Talkers.  Sometimes you just need to dive into the deep end. However, midway through, the pessimism starts to transform into optimism and thoughts of “I can do this” quickly spread. But the fight is far from over.  Don’t let this pink cloud distract you from the inevitable pain period which always ensues.  About ¾’s in, the optimism quickly turns it back on you. This is the pain period.  The period which is the defining differential between the ones that can power through and the ones that can’t. The time when you loosen your belt and really anchor that chair under you because its about the get real.   

This last Tuesday, I consumed (In entirety; in one sitting) the biggest burrito that I can every have the privilege of bringing into this word.  Midway through, I had to unbutton my pants but as a man of pure willpower, I conquered this baby sized masterpiece.
