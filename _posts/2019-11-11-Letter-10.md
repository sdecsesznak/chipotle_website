Dear Chipotle Headquarters, 

To follow-up on my application for Chipotle’s Lifelong taste tester, I would like to reiterate my interest in and enthusiasm for joining your team. As such, I would like to take a moment of your time to address several key points and explain why I will be of significant value to your organization.<br>
<br>
•	I have extensive experience in selling Chipotle’s commitment to high quality food procurement and preparation to my colleagues.  Whether they want to hear it or not.  <br>
•	My psychological evaluation of the Chipotle crew member before ordering was critical to maximizing rapport resulting in above average portions of meat and/or guacamole.<br>
•	As a Chipotle regular, I handle all trials in finding synergies between different line item combinations.   <br>
•	With more than 10 years of experience in eating Chipotle, I’ve experienced the orgasmic taste of each item with every combination possible.<br>
<br>
I hope that the above information demonstrates the utility I bring to Chipotle – today and in the future.  You will also find that my abilities to lead and motivate are strong and have always been part of the foundation for my personal success.  

Warm Regards,<br>
