Dear Chipotle Headquarters,<br>
<br>
Merry Christmas!  Here are a few of my favorite 2020 Highlights. <br>
<br>
**January** – Kissed a Chipotle burrito for the New Year.  The people at the NYE party I was at thought it was weird enough to question, so I took the party to back to my place ;).<br>
<br>
**February** – Took my girlfriend out to Chipotle for Valentine’s Day.  Turns out giving chocolates to the Chipotle worker behind the POS was NOT a romantic gesture and would cost me my relationship.   <br>
<br>
**March** – Learned the hard way that hanging around Chipotle and pinching every customer who didn’t order guacamole is NOT in the spirit of St. Patrick’s Day.  <br>
<br>
**April** – On April Fool’s Day my roommate ordered Qdoba when he explicitly told me Chipotle.  April 1st happens to also be National Burrito Day.  Turns out some relationships aren’t worth salvaging. <br>
<br>
**May** – My Mom loved the Chipotle gift card I got her for Mother’s Day. <br>
<br>
**June** – My Dad loved the Chipotle gift card I got him for Father’s Day.<br>
<br>
**July** – Firecrackers and a Qdoba burrito are grounds for a goodtime. <br>
<br>
**August** – Pretending to be left-handed while in line at Chipotle is super anticlimactic.  <br>
<br>
**September** – No joke here.  Honored our fallen heroes on 911 Remembrance Day. <br>
<br>
**October** – For Boss’s Day I listened to Lonely Island’s hit song, Like a Boss all day on repeat.  My apartment neighbors addressed me as “Boss” for 2 weeks after.  Been chasing that high ever since.<br> 
<br>
**November** – Brought a Chipotle burrito bowl to Thanksgiving.  Told all my relatives that I am writing letters to Chipotle asking for free Burrito for Life.  Woke up the next morning and realized I hallucinated the whole thing. <br>   
<br>
**December** – Planning on spending Christmas with the immediate family which I love dearly. <br>
<br>
XOXO,<br>
