Dear Chipotle Headquarters,<br>
<br>
Thanksgiving was a success this year despite it being 2020.<br>
<br>
Like last year, I would like to give thanks to the many blessings in my life.  These include but are not limited to:<br>
	<br>
	• Chipotle's commitment to Real Food, Real Purpose, and Real Flavor. <br>
	• EXTRA GUAC on every burrito I BUY.<br>
	• Family and friends.<br>
	• Health. <br>
<br>
Besides celebrating Thanksgiving, I have been campaigning for what I believe to be one of the most important issues of my lifetime.<br>

The egregious fact that as an adult, my fashion choices are limited to inferior "adult" styles. <br>

I would appreciate your support in this matter. <br>  
Thank you.<br>
