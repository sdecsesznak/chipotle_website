To Whom It May Concern, 

If I’m being perfectly honest, my drive towards writing these letters has been diminishing.  I am not sure if my lack of motivation can be attributed to the excessive time I spend on Tik Tok, the countless hours of watching Vine Compilations, or merely my self-depreciating humor blossoming into a lifestyle.

This weekend, I took a drive down memory lane and watched one of my favorite movies – Shaw Shank Redemption.  A classic tale of a banker, Andy Dufresne, who was wrongfully convicted to prison for the murder of his wife.  Ending up in prison, Andy faces hardships as they arise but does not become discouraged. After many years, the protagonist breaks out of prison only to be reunited with his best-friend from prison.

Every time I watch this movie, it gives me something new to think about….While Andy Dufresne is in prison, he wrote a letter to the government every single week, asking for money to develop a library.  After six years the government writes back and says “Dear Mr. Dufresne we appreciate your persistence and enclosed is a check for $200 to go towards the prison library and there’s some also charitable donations of used books you can use to develop the library.”

While I am not asking for money or for books, I am asking for free burritos for life.  This is a big request and I do not take it lightly.  I understand the work involved and the discipline required to pull off a feat such as this. 

As you will glean in the months/years to come, I have some Andy Dufresne in me.  My sheer determination and persistence is one of my greatest assets.

Looking forward to taking this relationship to the next level. 

Yours Truly,<br>
