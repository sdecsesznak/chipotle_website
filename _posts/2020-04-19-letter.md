**Dear Chipotle Headquarters**, 

First off, let me introduce myself.  My name is Steven deCsesznak and I have been an enthusiastic Chipotlian for the past 10 years.  In the beginning of my Chipotle consuming career, my meal of choice was three chicken tacos with white rice, green salsa, cheese and lettuce.  This conservative meal choice reflected my angsty middle school attitude.  Eventually, as I consumed Chipotle more and more, the tacos started to become mundane.  It was in this time of crisis that I was able to break outside my comfort zone and order a burrito.  I remember that first bite like it was yesterday.  After stripping down the top of the burrito bare naked, some primitive instinct came over me and I aggressively bit the top corner of the burrito.  This was not like any bite that I have ever taken; no, this bite was the result of some innate animalistic behavior that took control.  Looking back at this important milestone, this bite represents the start of my pilgrimage to explore Chipotle’s menu with no reservations or limitations.  

I can confidently say that I have tried every item on the Chipotle menu, visited the original Chipotle in Denver not once but three times, and had the unique invitation to go behind the counter and roll my own burrito (not going to divulge any more information because I’m sure this violates some health codes).  

The purpose of this letter is to inquire about Chipotle’s VIP burrito card.  As a long time Chipotle connoisseur, I cannot help but to be envious of the exclusive burritos for life club members.  Although I am not a celebrity, famous athlete or public figure, what I lack in social media followers, I make up for with my self-deprecating humor, outlandish vine references, and most importantly, my persistence.  

I look forward to hearing from you.  

Yours Truly,


Steven A. deCsesznak
