Dear Chipotle Headquarters, 

It is with great enthusiasm that I express my satisfaction with this past Thanksgiving.  Good Food.  Good Company. Good Times.  While this was my 24th Thanksgiving, I celebrated many firsts.  Here are two that were the most memorable. 

Went to my first escape room.  Turns out the goal of the escape room is not to get out of the room as fast as possible.  If that were true, I would not be banned for life.   I still think “throwing a chair out the window and jumping through the 2nd story window” puts me in at least the top five contenders for the quickest escape.

Took my first red eye flight from Seattle to Chicago O’Hare.  Bad idea.  I boarded the flight at 1:00 am not knowing why they call it a red eye flight.  At 6:45 am I got off the plane looking like I was huffing glue in the bathroom for the majority of the flight.    
  
Sincerely,<br>
